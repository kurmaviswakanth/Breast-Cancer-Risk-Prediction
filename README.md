Built a system to predict breast cancer diagnosis using machine learning techniques

Developed a predictive model to classify breast cancer tumors based on data from Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA) tests. The model aimed to differentiate between malignant (cancerous) and benign (non-cancerous) tumors, providing valuable insights into early cancer detection.

Conducted comprehensive data preprocessing, including the removal of irrelevant features (such as the id column), handling missing values, and converting categorical data (e.g., diagnosis) into numerical formats to suit machine learning algorithms.

Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on key features such as tumor radius, texture, perimeter, and smoothness to understand their impact on the diagnosis. This analysis helped identify significant factors that influence tumor classification.

Applied machine learning algorithms for binary classification to predict the diagnosis of breast cancer. The models were trained to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on its attributes.

Tools and technologies used included Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation, and Google Colab for code execution and collaboration.

Achieved an accuracy of 97.08% using Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines (SVM) after hyperparameter tuning (surpassing industry standard of ~95% accuracy).
